# <Use case name>

## Use case

<!--
What behavior is being described?
Use a name that expresses domain behavior, not only a technical action.
-->

## Meaning

<!--
What does this behavior mean in the domain?
Why does it matter?
-->

## Actor or trigger

<!--
Who needs, starts, triggers, or benefits from this behavior?
This can be a user, role, system, event, schedule, or process.
-->

## Related scenario

<!--
Which context gives meaning to this behavior?
-->

## Related process or workflow

<!--
Where does this behavior appear operationally?
-->

## Preconditions

<!--
What must already be true before this behavior can happen?
-->

## Expected consequence

<!--
What changes if this succeeds?
State, responsibility, availability, commitment, visibility, notification, etc.
-->

## Main behavior

<!--
Describe the meaningful behavior.
Avoid implementation details unless they affect domain meaning.

3. <Step or behavior fragment>

## Alternative behavior

<!--
What valid variants exist?
-->

## Validations

<!--
What must be true before or during execution?
-->

| Validation | Reason | Expected error |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <condition> | <why it matters> | <domain-relevant failure> |

## Business rules

<!--
Which domain rules shape what is allowed, denied, calculated, selected, or produced?
-->

## Expected errors

<!--
Known domain-relevant failures.
These are not unexpected crashes. They are part of the behavior.
-->

| Error | Meaning | When it happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <error-name> | <domain meaning> | <condition> |

## Postconditions

<!--
What must be true after successful execution?
-->

## Inputs
